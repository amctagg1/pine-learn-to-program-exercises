# In the early days of Roman numeral, the Romans didn't bother with any of this
# New-fangled subtraction "IX" nonsense.
# No sir, it was straight addition, biggest to littlest.
# So 9 was written 'VIIII'

# Write a method that when passed an integer between 1 and 3000
# Returns a string containing the proper old-school Roman numeral.

# Make sure to test your method on a bunch of different numbers
# Hint: use the integer division and modulus methods

# For reference, these are the values of the letters used:
# I = 1  V = 5  X = 10  L = 50  C = 100  D = 500  M = 1000
